## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
  
- I started the use of patterns from the W3. I used the html code , as close as possible , and implemented my own js and css code , otherwise I'm just copying /pasting everything and do not learn a thing. The use of the W3 html pattern code , with ARIA, ensures the correct accessiblity code.
- I used W3 patterns for both the tabs and accordion. 
- And off course I removed all traces of Bootstrap, as I heard it's better not to use and to just stick to CSS/SCSS.
  Bootstrap served me well, but from now on I will not be using it , unless asked to by future employers.
- I still have used a little jQuery as some methods more convenient in jQuery , in my case toggleClass() etc.
- I also decided to ,again, just add the font I'm using , instead of linking to it, as it reduces resource loading time.
- I used a report from lighthouse to check how my page did, and it was all 90+ for both mobile and desktop.
- I could have used 'lazy loading' of images as well, but my page results seem okay so I left it at that.
  
  

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
